Emacs-lisp functions for creating CAD files

This package lets you design two-dimensional shapes by running pieces of Lisp.

The plan is to have several back ends, including GCODE and SVG.  The
SVG output will integrate with Emacs' SVG display; but the main aim is
to produce GCODE directly, sidestepping CNC machines' shoddy
conversion programs.
